# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview  
This project builds a movie recommendation system using the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset. The goal is to suggest relevant movies to users based on various techniques, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), similarity and distance metrics, recommendation algorithms, classification, clustering, and association rules. The system uses content-based filtering and could be extended with collaborative filtering if rating data were available.

## Dataset  
The TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset contains metadata for 5,000 movies, including features like:
- Title
- Genres
- Cast
- Release Year
- Budget
- Popularity
- Vote Count
- Revenue

Dataset available at: [TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

## Techniques Used  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and converting JSON strings to lists.  
   - Feature Distribution: Analyzing features like budget, popularity, and release year.  
   - Correlation Analysis: Identifying relationships between features (e.g., Budget and Revenue).

2. **Similarity and Distance**  
   - TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Cosine Similarity are used to compute the similarity between movie descriptions.

3. **Recommendation System**  
   - A content-based recommendation system is implemented using Cosine Similarity to recommend similar movies based on plot descriptions.

4. **Classification**  
   - Classification models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Regression, and Random Forest are used to predict whether a movie will have high revenue.

5. **Clustering**  
   - DBSCAN and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) are applied to group movies based on their genres.

6. **Association Rules**  
   - Association Rule Mining is used to find frequent genre combinations and their relationships.


## Usage  
1. **Run EDA**  
   To perform the exploratory data analysis:
   ```bash
   python eda.py
   ```

2. **Generate Recommendations**  
   To generate movie recommendations based on plot descriptions:
   ```bash
   python recommendation_system.py
   ```

3. **Train Classification Models**  
   To train and evaluate classification models for predicting high revenue:
   ```bash
   python classification.py
   ```

4. **Apply Clustering**  
   To cluster movies based on genres:
   ```bash
   python clustering.py
   ```

5. **Association Rules**  
   To generate and visualize association rules between genres:
   ```bash
   python association_rules.py
   ```

## Future Work  
- **Collaborative Filtering:** If rating data is available, collaborative filtering can be implemented to enhance the recommendation system by considering user preferences.
